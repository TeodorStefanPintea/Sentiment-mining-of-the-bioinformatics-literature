This is the git repository containing my final year project.

Under the tab "Projects" a JIRA board can be seen where I will track my weekly, monthly and daily tasks.

Here, I will also be able to simulate the industry environment almost perfectly and work on different branches, with relevant commits, a production environment (master branch) and a development environment (dev branch/es).
